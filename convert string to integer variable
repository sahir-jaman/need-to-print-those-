 converting char to int :------
 
 
Depends on what you want to do:

to read the value as an ascii code, you can write

char a = 'a';
int ia = (int)a; 
/* note that the int cast is not necessary -- int ia = a would suffice */

***to convert the character '0' -> 0, '1' -> 1, etc, you can write

char a = '4';
int ia = a - '0';
/* check here if ia is bounded by 0 and 9 */

*** to convert the charecter 0 --> '0' , 1--->'1' ect, you can write
  int a=5;
  char=a+'0';
  
  note: so, if u see carefully --- there is only + and - defference
